# Rule set:
# If we have any "knight": send it to attack to the nearest enemy unit
# If we have a base: train worker/peasant until we have 2 workers
# If we have a barracks: train knight
# If we have a worker/peasant: do this if needed: build base, build barracks, harvest resource of the least amount

# Notes:
# - Generally this uses Prolog syntax
# - numbers and strings surrounded by double quotes are constants (1, 3, "Base", etc.)
# - symbols starting with an upper case letter are variables (X, Y, etc.)
# - ~ represents negation
# - the comparison operators (>; <) should only be applicable if the variables are bound, otherwise they should fail.

# Notes:
# - Actions are of the form doXXX(ID): they make the unit with the specified ID perform an action
#
# Actions that can be performed:
# - doTrainWorker: trains a worker/peasant
# - doTrainKnight: trains a Knight unit
# - doBuildBase: builds a base in a nearby position
# - doBuildBarracks: builds a barracks in a nearby position
# - doHarvest: sends a worker/peasant to harvest resources from a gold mine or tree
# - doAttack: attacks a nearby enemy
#
# Predefined predicates that need to be implemented:
# - idle(ID): whether the unit specified by ID is idle (if ID is unbound, ID will be bound to each of the idle units, one at a time, Prolog-style)
# - own(ID): whether we own the unit with the specified ID (if ID is unbound, ID will be bound to each of the units we own, one at a time)
# - enemy(ID): same as "own(ID)", but for enemy units.
# - workersAvailable(X): binds X to the number of workers we have
# - goldAvailable(X): binds X to the number of gold resources we have
# - goldNeededFor(UnitType,Y): binds Y to the number of gold resources needed to train UnitType
# - woodAvailable(X): binds X to the number of wood resources we have
# - woodNeededFor(UnitType,Y): binds Y to the number of wood resources needed to train UnitType
# - type(X,UnitType): true if the unit type of X is UnitType
# - ~ means negation
#
# The idea here is:
# - At each game frame, check one rule at a time, and for each rule which is satisfied, send the corresponding command to the corresponding units.
